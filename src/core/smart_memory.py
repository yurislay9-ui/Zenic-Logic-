"""
TITAN OMNISCALE X - SmartMemory (Intelligent Memory for Qwen)

Thin facade that re-exports from the modularized memory_parts sub-package.
All implementation has been moved to:
  - memory_parts/types.py      — MemoryEntry dataclass + constants
  - memory_parts/database.py   — DB initialization, migration, connections mixin
  - memory_parts/cache.py      — Semantic cache + working memory mixin
  - memory_parts/longterm.py   — Long-term memory + similarity search mixin
  - memory_parts/episodes.py   — Episodes, patterns, projects mixin
  - memory_parts/memory.py     — SmartMemory class (combines all mixins)
