"""
ZENIC LOGIC — Shared Retry Utility.

NOTE: This is the simple procedural retry. For the RetryConfig-based version
used by the server/circuit-breaker, see src.core.patterns.resilience.retry.
For the v18 agent decorator version, see src.core.agents_v2.resilience.retry.

Eliminates duplicated retry-with-exponential-backoff patterns across
all engine modules. Every engine had its own copy of the same retry loop;
this module provides a single source of truth.

Usage:
    from src.core.shared.retry import with_retry

    result = with_retry(
        fn=lambda: conn.execute("SELECT ..."),
        max_retries=3,
        base_delay=0.1,
        label="GraphAST store_node",
    )
